> A simple app based on the Redux tutorial made by Brad Traversy which can be found on his YouTube channel. I created this app to learn Redux. In comparison to Brad's code, I've refactored the components to functional instead of class components and also implemented redux using the hooks which are provided in react-redux package.

### Tech Stack

- React
- Redux (with redux-thunk)
